# Shipping Cost Optimization in E-Commerce

This project analyzes and compares real-world and hypothetical shipping cost models in an e-commerce scenario.

## Goals
- Evaluate baseline shipping cost assumptions
- Compare with a tiered, hypothesis-based model
- Explore strategies to increase profitability via shipping optimization
- (Optional) Train a model to predict or reduce shipping cost using machine learning

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- PostgreSQL
- Tableau (for visualization)

## Key Questions
- How can we reduce shipping cost per order?
- Which customers/orders are the most cost-efficient?
- Does grouping items provide a significant cost benefit?
